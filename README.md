Hello World! I'm Pramod🚀
I spent years mastering the Mathematics behind data and the Science of modeling it. Now, I’m focused on the Engineering required to make it scale.

Currently working as a Senior Data Analyst in a Tier-1 financial institution in London, I’ve seen firsthand how fragile data pipelines can break even the best ML models. I’m spending my time building the "plumbing" that ensures data is clean, consistent, and fast.

🔭 Currently Working On:

Migrating legacy financial reporting scripts into automated Airflow DAGs.

Building a personal project for real-time crypto-data ingestion using Kafka and PostgreSQL.

Mastering IaC (Terraform) to manage cloud data warehouses.
